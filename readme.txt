ABOUT THIS APP

This app was created to reduce the amount of
effort to export the names of media in a Plex
database with an application and argument from
CLI.

To run this application, run this in CLI:

PlexDBtoCSV.exe -path "full path to plex.db"

The application will create a data.csv in the
same folder as an output.

The plex_sql.txt can be edit if you need a
custom query.

Copy of this code without the content of the
